# Pixel-Art Maker
A javascript based pixel art maker made for my 'Intro to Programming' Nanodegree at Udacity

Source code for a pixel art maker, contained in three files (.html, .css, ,js)

I implemented functionality in javascript that takes user input to create a grid upon which the user can change the color of individual cells by picking a color, and then clicking on the cell.
